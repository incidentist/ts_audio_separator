# MDX Separator - Save Output Files Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully completed the implementation to save the model output as playable WAV files. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made

1. **Refactored `saveAudioOutput` method** in `MDXSeparator.ts`:
   - Now returns a blob URL instead of void
   - Creates audio blobs with metadata (name, size, blob object)
   - Stores blobs in global object for easy access

2. **Updated `separate` method** in `MDXSeparator.ts`:
   - Stores returned blob URLs in output array
   - Returns array of blob URLs instead of file paths

3. **Enhanced test file** (`mdx-separator.spec.ts`):
   - Added file system imports for saving files
   - Converts blobs to base64 for transfer out of browser context
   - Saves separated audio files to disk in `tests/output` directory
   - Fixed missing outputBlobs check in test

4. **Created manual test page** (`separation-test.html`):
   - Provides UI for testing separation
   - Shows audio players for original, vocals, and instrumental
   - Includes download buttons for separated tracks
   - Displays detailed logs of the separation process

### How to Use

1. **Run the automated test**:
   ```bash
   npm test mdx-separator
   ```
   This will process `heard_sound.flac` and save the separated tracks to `tests/output/`.

2. **Manual testing**:
   - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Open `http://localhost:5173/separation-test.html` in your browser
   - Click "Start Separation Test" to process the audio
   - Listen to the separated tracks and download them

### Output Format

The separated audio files are saved as:
- `vocals.wav` - The isolated vocal track
- `instrumental.wav` - The instrumental track without vocals

Both files are standard WAV format that can be played in any audio player.

### Technical Details

- The implementation follows the structure of the Python audio-separator closely
- Blob URLs are used for browser compatibility
- Files are saved as 16-bit WAV with the configured sample rate (44100 Hz)
- The `demix` method uses the original implementation with `initializeMix` to maintain compatibility

The separation process is now complete end-to-end, producing playable WAV files that you can listen to and verify the quality of the separation.
